## Minimum Holdings and registering
To be a member of the brother's community, you need to hold at least **0.2 $BRO**.
Otherwise you will be kicked out the channel by the bot.

Every user has to register via bot to the smart contract *bro-registry*.
To guarantee confidentiality, TG accounts are encrypted on-chain. And only the operator of the
bot knows the password that can associate a TG account to a $BRO account.

## Mining

$BRO is mined by tipping. Tips can be obtained in Brothers TG group by doing KCP
(KCP means Kadena Culture Production = Producing original Meme).
The tip amount is **1 GiDoug** (**0.001 $BRO**). To limit inflation, the smart-contract enforces a maximum of 10 tips / hour.

Tips are paid from the *Public Treasury*.

## Liquidity Management + Self pumping
The Liquidity reserved **40.0 $BRO** + KDA income from pre-sales (expected 1000.0 KDA) are owned by the Smart Contract (= the community).
There are 100% deployed on eckoDex for liquidity.

Earned DEX fees are automatically:
* **$BRO**: Transferred to the *Public Treasury* (to be used as future tips)
* **KDA**: Swapped to $BRO (self pumping) and transferred to the *Public Treasury*

(Expected $BRO initial price = 25.0 KDA)
